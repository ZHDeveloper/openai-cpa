# Email OTP Retrieval & Mailbox Integration Utility

[中文文档](./README.zh-CN.md)

A Python utility for mailbox integration, one-time passcode (OTP) retrieval, message parsing, proxy-aware email polling, local JSON backup, and optional internal credential-file inventory checks.

> Use only in systems and environments you own or are explicitly authorized to test.
> Make sure your use complies with applicable laws, platform rules, and service terms.

## ✨ Features

#### Flexible mailbox and verification workflow
- **Multi-backend mailbox support**: Natively supports `cloudflare_temp_email`, `freemail`, and standard `imap` mailbox backends, with flexible switching through the configuration file.
- **Dual-path domain rotation**: Supports custom multi-domain pools defined in configuration for randomized distribution; in `freemail` mode, it can also dynamically fetch available domains from the API and rotate among them automatically.

#### CPA inventory maintenance and operations
- **Automated inventory inspection**: Provides an optional CPA maintenance mode that periodically checks account inventory in the CPA system and performs health and availability inspection.
- **Invalid credential cleanup**: Supports a configurable weekly quota threshold. When an account is identified as exhausted, deactivated, or invalid, it can be removed from inventory automatically.
- **Low-inventory replenishment**: Monitors effective account inventory in the CPA system and can trigger a preset replenishment batch when stock drops below the configured safety threshold.
- **Credential renewal support**: When stored credentials are approaching expiration or have become invalid, the system can attempt refresh-based renewal and update the stored credential set.

#### Archival output and privacy protection
- **Controllable local archival**: In standard mode, JSON credentials and `accounts.txt` records can be stored locally by default. In CPA replenishment mode, the separate `save_to_local` switch lets you decide whether to retain a local backup while uploading remotely.
- **CPA API upload integration**: Supports automatically pushing newly generated JSON credentials or refreshed valid credentials to the CPA internal API for centralized storage and retrieval.
- **Log privacy masking**: Includes built-in masking for mailbox domain output in standard console logs to reduce direct exposure of sensitive information.

#### Configuration and network resilience
- **Centralized YAML configuration**: Core runtime behavior—including proxy settings, retry counts, mailbox mode, output directory, and CPA inspection / backup parameters—is controlled through a single YAML configuration file.
- **Flexible network routing**: Supports a global proxy configuration and allows separate proxy behavior for mailbox API requests or IMAP connections to adapt to different network environments.
- **Retry handling for unstable networks**: Provides basic anti-jitter and timeout retry handling at key network request points to improve stability in unattended or unstable network scenarios.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `curl_cffi`
- `PySocks` (only needed if you want IMAP connections to go through a proxy)

## Installation

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install PyYAML PySocks curl_cffi
```

## Configuration

The project now uses `config.yaml` in the repository root as the single configuration entry point, rather than editing constants directly inside the script.

A typical configuration looks like this:

```yaml
# [Mail backend mode]
# Available values: "imap" / "freemail" / "cloudflare_temp_email"
email_api_mode: "cloudflare_temp_email"

# [Shared settings for cloudflare_temp_email / imap]
mail_domains: "domain1.com,domain2.xyz,domain3.net"
gptmail_base: "https://your-domain.com"

# [Proxy configuration]
default_proxy: ""

# [Mode-specific settings: imap]
imap:
  server: "imap.gmail.com"
  port: 993
  user: ""
  pass: ""

# [Mode-specific settings: freemail]
freemail:
  api_url: "https://your-domain.com"
  api_token: ""

# [Mode-specific settings: cloudflare_temp_email]
admin_auth: ""

# [OTP resend retries]
max_otp_retries: 5

# [Mail-side proxy options]
use_proxy_for_email: false
enable_email_masking: true

# [Local output directory]
token_output_dir: ""

# [CPA maintenance mode]
cpa_mode:
  enable: false
  save_to_local: true
  api_url: "http://your-domain.com:8317"
  api_token: "xxxx"
  min_accounts_threshold: 30
  batch_reg_count: 1
  min_remaining_weekly_percent: 80
  check_interval_minutes: 60
```

### 1. `email_api_mode`

Selects which mailbox backend mode to use. Supported values:

- `cloudflare_temp_email`
- `freemail`
- `imap`

Mode summary:

- **`cloudflare_temp_email`**: Uses a temp-mail style backend and requires `gptmail_base` plus `admin_auth`
- **`freemail`**: Uses a Freemail-compatible API and requires `freemail.api_url` plus `freemail.api_token`
- **`imap`**: Uses a real mailbox over IMAP and requires `imap.server / port / user / pass`

### 2. `mail_domains`

Defines the mailbox domain pool. Multiple domains can be separated with commas.

Example:

```yaml
mail_domains: "a.com,b.net,c.org"
```

The script generates mailbox addresses using a random prefix plus a randomly selected domain. If you only use one domain, simply provide one value.

### 3. `gptmail_base`

Base URL for the Cloudflare Temp Mail-style backend. This is only used when `email_api_mode: "cloudflare_temp_email"`.

Example:

```yaml
gptmail_base: "https://mail-api.example.com"
```

Do not include a trailing slash.

### 4. `default_proxy`

Global proxy address used for primary network requests.

Example:

```yaml
default_proxy: "http://127.0.0.1:7897"
```

Or:

```yaml
default_proxy: "socks5://127.0.0.1:1080"
```

Leave it empty if your runtime environment already has direct connectivity.

### 5. `imap`

When `email_api_mode` is set to `imap`, configure the following block:

```yaml
imap:
  server: "imap.gmail.com"
  port: 993
  user: "your_mailbox@example.com"
  pass: "your_app_password"
```

Field notes:

- `server`: IMAP server address, such as `imap.gmail.com` or `imap.qq.com`
- `port`: IMAP SSL port, typically `993`
- `user`: mailbox login, usually the full email address
- `pass`: IMAP password; for many providers this should be an app password or authorization code rather than the normal web password

### 6. `freemail`

When `email_api_mode` is set to `freemail`, configure:

```yaml
freemail:
  api_url: "https://your-domain.com"
  api_token: ""
```

Field notes:

- `api_url`: base URL of the Freemail-compatible API
- `api_token`: Bearer token used for authentication

### 7. `admin_auth`

When `email_api_mode` is set to `cloudflare_temp_email`, this field is used as the administrator credential for the temp-mail backend.

Example:

```yaml
admin_auth: "your_admin_secret"
```

### 8. `max_otp_retries`

Controls the maximum number of resend / retry attempts when OTP retrieval fails.

Example:

```yaml
max_otp_retries: 5
```

When messages are delayed or OTP extraction fails, the script uses this value to determine retry behavior.

### 9. `use_proxy_for_email`

Controls whether mailbox-side requests should also use the proxy.

```yaml
use_proxy_for_email: false
```

- `false`: mailbox APIs / IMAP connections are direct by default
- `true`: mailbox APIs / IMAP connections also go through the proxy

Enable this only when your mailbox API or IMAP service must be accessed through a proxy.

### 10. `enable_email_masking`

Controls whether mailbox domains are masked in console logs.

```yaml
enable_email_masking: true
```

- `true`: logs display masked mailbox output
- `false`: logs display the full mailbox address

### 11. `token_output_dir`

Specifies the local output directory.

```yaml
token_output_dir: ""
```

- Empty: output is written to the current script directory
- Set a path: output is written to the specified directory

The script creates the directory automatically when needed.

### 12. `cpa_mode`

`cpa_mode` is an optional maintenance configuration block for inventory inspection and upkeep:

```yaml
cpa_mode:
  enable: false
  save_to_local: true
  api_url: "http://your-domain.com:8317"
  api_token: "xxxx"
  min_accounts_threshold: 30
  batch_reg_count: 1
  min_remaining_weekly_percent: 80
  check_interval_minutes: 60
```

Field notes:

- `enable`: enables CPA maintenance mode
- `save_to_local`: whether to retain a local backup while uploading remotely in CPA mode
- `api_url`: CPA internal API endpoint
- `api_token`: CPA API credential / token
- `min_accounts_threshold`: triggers replenishment logic when inventory falls below this value
- `batch_reg_count`: number of items processed in each replenishment batch
- `min_remaining_weekly_percent`: threshold used in health assessment logic
- `check_interval_minutes`: inspection interval in minutes

### 13. Configuration suggestions

- **IMAP only**: focus on `email_api_mode`, `mail_domains`, `imap`, and `use_proxy_for_email`
- **Freemail API only**: focus on `email_api_mode`, `freemail.api_url`, and `freemail.api_token`
- **Cloudflare Temp Mail backend only**: focus on `email_api_mode`, `mail_domains`, `gptmail_base`, and `admin_auth`
- **Inventory maintenance enabled**: additionally complete the full `cpa_mode` block

## Usage

Run normally:

```bash
python wfxl_openai_regst.py
```

Run once:

```bash
python wfxl_openai_regst.py --once
```

## Output Files

Typical output files include:

### JSON files

Example:

```text
token_user_example.com_1711111111.json
```

These store structured output data.

### `accounts.txt`

Example content:

```text
example@gmail.com----password123
```

Use care when storing or handling this file.

## Troubleshooting

### Gmail IMAP login fails
Check the following:
- IMAP is enabled
- 2-Step Verification is enabled if App Passwords are required
- you are using an App Password, not the normal account password
- organizational policy does not block IMAP or App Passwords

### QQ Mail IMAP login fails
Check the following:
- IMAP is enabled
- you are using the mailbox authorization code
- you are not using the standard web-login password

### Mailbox is created but no email arrives
Possible causes:
- the email landed in spam
- proxy routing breaks email connectivity
- `MAIL_DOMAINS` is incorrect
- API auth is invalid
- mailbox backend is not returning the expected message list

### OTP is not extracted
Possible causes:
- the email body encoding is unusual
- the verification code is not a 6-digit number
- the message content does not match the extraction patterns
- the message detail endpoint contains the code but the list view does not

## Security Notes

- Do not expose `accounts.txt` or JSON credential outputs publicly.
- Prefer environment variables for sensitive configuration.
- Restrict access to the output directory.
- If used in a team setting, add audit logging and permission boundaries.

## Notes
- This repository is intended for research, testing, and internal workflow automation.
- Please ensure your usage complies with applicable laws, platform policies, and service terms.
- Review and adapt configuration values before running in any real environment.
